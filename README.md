## üöö Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a systematic and practical framework for SVM systems on semi-trailer trucks, aiming to generate high-fidelity Bird‚Äôs-Eye-View (BEV) images. The goal is to enhance situational awareness and support safe operations, such as transporting Modular Integrated Construction (MiC) modules in urban environments.

The framework includes:
- **Camera Placement Optimization (CPO):** Determines the optimal number and positions of fisheye cameras to maximize BEV image fidelity while minimizing hardware cost.
- **Spatial‚ÄìTemporal Fusion Articulation-Angle Estimation (AAE):** A camera-only method that robustly estimates the articulation angle between the tractor and trailer, even under occlusions or disturbances.
- **Dynamic Image Concatenation (DIC):** Produces seamless BEV images by selecting the optimal image source for each pixel rather than relying on traditional seam-based stitching.
