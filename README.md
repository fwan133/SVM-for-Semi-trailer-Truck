## üöö Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a **systematic and theoretically feasible framework** for SVM systems on semi-trailer trucks. The goal is to improve situational awareness and support safe operations such as transporting Modular Integrated Construction (MiC) modules in urban environments.

The framework includes:
- **Camera Placement Optimization (CPO):** Determines the optimal number and positions of fisheye cameras to maximize BEV image fidelity while minimizing hardware cost.
- **Spatial‚ÄìTemporal Fusion Articulation-Angle Estimation (AAE):** A camera-only method that robustly estimates the articulation angle between the tractor and trailer, even under occlusions or disturbances.
- **Dynamic Image Concatenation (DIC):** Produces seamless BEV images by selecting the optimal image source for each pixel rather than relying on traditional seam-based stitching.

## ‚ú® Key Features
- üì∑ **Optimized camera placement** for high coverage and clear BEV images.
- üîó **Robust articulation angle estimation** using spatial‚Äìtemporal fusion and Kalman filtering.
- üñºÔ∏è **High-fidelity BEV image generation** with reduced distortion for near-field 3D objects.
- ‚öôÔ∏è Designed for **scalability** to various semi-trailer configurations.

## üñ•Ô∏è Simulation Platform
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS
- **CPU:** Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i9‚Äë14900K √ó32
- **GPU:** NVIDIA RTX 4090D
- **Memory:** 94 GB
- **Simulation Frame Rate:** 10 FPS (due to rendering constraints of the simulation environment)

## üìä Evaluation
The evaluation focuses on:
- Accuracy of **articulation angle estimation**
- Overall **BEV image quality**
- **Computational efficiency** of the BEV pipeline

### Real-Time Performance
- Articulation angle estimation: **57.82 ms / frame**
- BEV image generation: **7.94 ms / frame**
- Achieved up to **17.3 FPS** in simulation

> Future work aims to integrate GPU acceleration and real-world testing to further enhance performance.

## üìà Future Work
- Develop **fiducial‚Äëmarker‚Äëbased calibration** for real-world camera extrinsics.
- Integrate **roll and pitch modeling** to improve BEV accuracy on uneven terrain.
- Incorporate **height and depth estimation** (e.g., via stereo vision or LiDAR fusion).
- Extend functionalities for **3D object detection, obstacle warnings, and trajectory prediction**.
